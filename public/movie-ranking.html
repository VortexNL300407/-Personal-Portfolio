 <hr/>
        <h3> Sider-man : Across The Spider-verse 🕷️ </h3>
        <p>If you have never watched this movie, watch it! It has amazing visuals, colours, and animations.<br/>
        Every single scene along with its colour pallete, art-style, and character tones have been so meticulously thought out. <br/>
        truly just a beautiful movie</p>

        <h3> Avengers : Endgame </h3>
        <p>Need i say more?</p>

        <h3> The Wild Robot 🤖🥬 </h3>
        <p>This movie takes such a beautiful message of parental love into, in this case a robot, that is often depicted as emotionless</p>

        <h3> Avengers : Infinity War </h3>
        <p>ABSOLUTE CINEMA. From the pacing, the characters, the amazing Thanos as a villain, all the way to the peak climax of the movie. It'll leave you with your jaws dropped to bedrock</p>

        <h3> Kung Fu Panda 2 </h3>
        <p>What a gem of a sequel. It was able to build upon the first movie, explore Po's past, all while juggling such a fun plot to follow. Ultimately, I think this was the best of all 4 Kung fu Pand movies.</p>
